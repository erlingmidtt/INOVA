					<figcaption>Lima's bollboard-purifier<span>Advertising billboard that gives access to drinking water</span></figcaption>
					<p>We got contacted by the department of engeneering at the university of Lima in Peru. 
						While their air is very humid they only have 2,5 cm of rain every year. They had an idea where they 
						would put up a giant advertising billboard that absorbs humid air and converts it in to purified water,
						generating more then 90 liters per day.
They contacted us with the idea and had a small demostration prototype where they showed how it would work. They did not have the resources to put up 
						one in the scale they needed. And even less so more then one.
To make this billboard possible they first had to contact the city department and ask for permission, seeing as the idea is the best solution to get 
						water in the town it got granted
Then they made a list of requirements necessary to complete the billboard. Ranging from material to help with finding the most practical solutions.
We helped them to get funds for the giant billboard and also sent the idea to the universities we are in touch with to see if they could help with finding solutions.</p>

					<figcaption>"Mitti Cool"<span>Clay fridge</span></figcaption>
					<p>In India there is a guy who had an idea for a fridge that uses no electricity. Mansukh Prajapati. 
						The fridge is made out of clay and can keep fruits and vegetables fresh for many days.
Mr Prajapati came to us because he wanted to spread this first and formost over India and eventually the world. The invention is fairly simple 
						but together with him we had to find a solution that would benefit as many people as possible 
						with as little material as possible. We also helped him with funding for making the idea spread.</p>
